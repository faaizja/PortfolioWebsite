            <p className="lg:pt-10 pt-5 text-md lg:text-xl font-interTight text-balance">I’m currently in my third year studying Computing Science and Interactive Systems at Simon Fraser University, 
                where I specialize in game development and front-end design. 
                My coursework blends technical skills with creativity, 
                allowing me to explore everything from coding dynamic interfaces to creating engaging user experiences. 
                Through hands-on projects, I’m building a solid foundation in 
                developing intuitive applications that prioritize usability and innovation.

            <p className="lg:pt-10 pt-8 lg:text-xl text-md font-interTight text-balance">I’m passionate about front-end development, game development, and full-stack application development. 
                My projects have involved technologies like Java, C++, React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, and MongoDB, 
                allowing me to enhance my technical skills and gain insight into creating user-focused applications.
